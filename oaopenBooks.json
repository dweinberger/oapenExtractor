Within this context, chapters tackle particular aspects, from epigraphy, papyrology and manuscripts, via Greek language, linguistics and literature, to imaging and modelling of artefacts, architecture, and technologies and methods in digital classics research. The book is aimed for scholars in the various fields of history, classical studies, digital humanities and archaeology. It will also be of interest to researchers in library and information sciences, informatics and pedagogy. The chapters will be divided into three sections: Section 1: Teaching will discuss the contribution of digital humanities to pedagogy, teaching and learning in the classics, including the creation of classroom or online materials for the study of languages, texts or topics in ancient history and archaeology, and the teaching of digital humanities techniques such as text encoding and linguistic analysis. All of the chapters in this section acknowledge that the division between digital methods for teaching, and research into digital tools is a porous one, and that digital approaches are helping to break down the divide between the researcher and the student. Section 2: Knowledge Exchange will focus on digital research projects or activities that bring together scholars or practitioners from outside of the traditional disciplines classicists and digital humanists are used to working with, or from outside of academia at all. Collaborations with the medical sciences, with library and cultural heritage institutions, and with media and gaming industries all benefit both parties, with expertise and new insights into research questions moving in both directions. Section 3: Public Engagement will discuss issues such as crowd-sourcing or \u201ccitizen science\u201d, which serves not only to harvest the expertise or enthusiasm of non-specialists on a large scale, but arguably even more profitably engages the crowd with scholarly materials in a way that they might never have considered before; also publications of classical material that are targeted at a non-academic audience: popular books, documentaries, games, open access publications that are available far beyond the university library. Considering that the research that enables the production of such scholarly materials is often made possible thanks to public funding we believe that more attention could profitably be paid to reflecting on the extent to which the wider public is aware of and benefits from\u2014 and even is able to contribute to\u2014such materials. Some of the chapters in this volume arose from papers given at the Digital Classicist seminars in Berlin or London between 2011 and 2013, but the majority are newly conceived or commissioned afresh for this publication. The international community of scholars in which this collection is coming into being, however, has been formed around both sets of seminars (plus those in Leipzig, New York University and Tufts, Boston), a series of conference panels, and previous volumes arising from them published by the Digital Medievalist journal, Ashgate Press and a supplement to the Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies respectively. These publications have proved popular with both digital humanities and traditional classics audiences, and have been widely reviewed in the journals of both disciplines. A similarly wide audience is envisioned for the current volume, which will be of relevance both to scholars in the various fields of classics, archaeology and history covered by the chapters (from epigraphy, papyrology and manuscripts, via Greek language, linguistics and literature, to imaging and modelling of artefacts and architecture) and to academics in digital humanities, library and information science, informatics and pedagogy whose domain of expertise is relevant to the technologies and methods further applied and discussed in the chapters. All of the chapters in this volume are conventional scholarly contributions in their own right, presenting research questions in classics or digital humanities (or in many cases both). They are all also examples of work within one of the most important area of academia today: scholarly outputs that address an audience other than the colleagues who work down the corridor (or at the other end of a VOIP connection) from us, be they our students, academics in very different fields from our own, or the broader public. As Greg Crane has argued, collaboration particularly with better-funded and more high-tech disciplines is essential to digital humanities but even more so to digital classics. Especially in the current climate of challenges to academic budgets and resources, the importance of engaging with audiences outside of our own discipline is clear, both in terms of academic survival, and for meeting the criteria of academic role descriptions, promotion review panels or institutional assessments, which include impact, engagement, teaching and environment as well as conventional research output. The international perspectives on these issues are especially valuable in an increasingly connected, but still institutionally and administratively diverse world. The research addressed in several chapters in this volume includes issues around technical standards bodies like EpiDoc and the TEI, engaging with ways these standards are implemented, documented, taught, used in the process of transcribing and annotating texts, and used to generate publications and as the basis for advanced textual or corpus research. Other chapters focus on various aspects of philological research and content creation, including collaborative or community driven efforts, and the issues surrounding editorial oversight, curation, maintenance and sustainability of these resources. Research into the ancient languages and linguistics, in particular Greek, and the language teaching that is a staple of our discipline, are also discussed in several chapters, in particular for ways in which advanced research methods can lead into language technologies and vice versa and ways in which the skills around teaching can be used for public engagement, and vice versa. A common thread through much of the volume is the importance of open access publication or open source development and distribution of texts, materials, tools and standards, both because of the public good provided by such models (circulating materials often already paid for out of the public purse), and the ability to reach non-standard audiences, those who cannot access rich university libraries or afford expensive print volumes. Linked Open Data is another technology that results in wide and free distribution of structured information both within and outside academic circles, and several chapters present academic work that includes ontologies and RDF, either as a direct research output or as essential part of the communication and knowledge representation. Several chapters focus not on the literary and philological side of classics, but on the study of cultural heritage, archaeology, and the material supports on which original textual and artistic material are engraved or otherwise inscribed, addressing both the capture and analysis of artefacts in both 2D and 3D, the representation of data through archaeological standards, and the importance of sharing information and expertise between the several domains both within and without academia that study, record and conserve ancient objects. Almost without exception, the authors reflect on the issues of interdisciplinarity and collaboration, the relationship between their research practice and teaching and\/or communication with a wider public, and the importance of the role of the academic researcher in contemporary society and in the context of cutting edge technologies. How research is communicated in a world of instant- access blogging and 140-character micromessaging, and how our expectations of the media affect not only how we publish but how we conduct our research, are questions about which all scholars need to be aware and self-critical.","tags":["Classical Studies"],"creator":["Bodard ,Gabriel","Romanello ,Matteo"],"publisher":"Ubiquity Press","place":"London, UK","date":"2016","extent":[{"unit":"pages","quantity":"235"}],"bic":"HBLA1","keywords":"Classical Studies","description":"This volume, edited by the organizers of the \u201cDigital Classicist\u201d seminars series, presents research in classical studies, digital classics and digital humanities, bringing together scholarship that addresses the impact of the study of classical antiquity through computational methods on audiences such as scientists, heritage professionals, students and the general public.

Whilst the emergence of environmental disputes has sometimes attracted political repression, attempts have also been made in recent times to explore more functional approaches to their resolution.

Indeed, material affluence is often accompanied instead by greater social and individual distress. A growing literature within the humanities and social sciences is increasingly concerned to chart not only the underlying trends in recorded levels of happiness, but to consider what factors, if any, contribute to positive and sustainable experiences of well-being and quality of life. Increasingly, such research is focusing on the importance of values and beliefs in human satisfaction or quality of life; but the specific contribution of religion to these trends is relatively under-examined. This unique collection of essays seeks to rectify that omission, by identifying the nature and role of the religious contribution to wellbeing. A unique collection of nineteen leading scholars from the field of economics, psychology, public theology and social policy have been brought together in this volume to explore the religious contribution to the debate about happiness and well-being. These essays explore the religious dimensions to a number of key features of well-being, including marriage, crime and rehabilitation, work, inequality, mental health, environment, participation, institutional theory, business and trade. They engage particularly closely with current trends in economics in identifying alternative models of economic growth which focus on its qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions. This distinctive volume brings to public notice the nature and role of religion\u2019s contribution to wellbeing, including new ways of measurement and evaluation. As such, it represents a valuable and unprecedented resource for the development of a broad-based religious contribution to the field.

In the second section, expert contributors outline the technology and policy issues facing the development of major conventional and renewable energy sources. The third and final section explores policy and technology challenges and opportunities in the distribution and consumption of energy, in sectors such as transportation and the built environment. The book\u2019s epilogue suggests some future scenarios in energy distribution and use. \n\nThis title was made Open Access by libraries from around the world through Knowledge Unlatched.","seriesTitle":"Purdue Studies in Public Policy","license":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/4.0\/","vendorItemPage":"http:\/\/www.thepress.purdue.edu\/titles\/format\/9781557536617","seriesISSN":null,"grant":"Knowledge Unlatched","GrantNumber":null,"id":[{"source":"oapen_id","id":469619},{"source":"doi","id":null},{"source":"isbn","id":"9781557536617|9781612493091|9781612493107|9781557537010"}],"itemPage":"http:\/\/www.oapen.org\/record\/46961","downloadPage":"http:\/\/oapen.org\/download?type=document&docid=469619"},{"title":"In Search of the Amazon - Brazil, the United States and the Nature of a Region","language":"ENGLISH","abstract":"Chronicling the dramatic history of the Brazilian Amazon during the Second World War, Seth Garfield provides fresh perspectives on contemporary environmental debates.

Architecture in the Anthropocene: Encounters Among Design, Deep Time, Science and Philosophy intensifies the potential of this multidisciplinary discourse by bringing together essays, conversations, and design proposals that respond to the \u201cgeological imperative\u201d for contemporary architecture scholarship and practice.

Bellwood also discusses relationships between the prehistoric populations of the archipelago and those of neighboring regions such as Australia, New Guinea, and mainland Asia.","seriesTitle":null,"license":"http:\/\/press.anu.edu.au\/about\/conditions-use","vendorItemPage":"http:\/\/epress.anu.edu.au\/titles\/prehistory-of-the-indo-malaysian-archipelago","seriesISSN":null,"grant":null,"GrantNumber":null,"id":[{"source":"oapen_id","id":459472},{"source":"doi","id":null},{"source":"isbn","id":"9781921313127"}],"itemPage":"http:\/\/www.oapen.org\/record\/45947","downloadPage":"http:\/\/oapen.org\/download?type=document&docid=459472"},{"title":"China's New Place in a World in Crisis : Economic, Geopolitical and Environmental Dimensions","language":"ENGLISH","abstract":"The world and China\u2019s place in it have been transformed over the past year.

Indigenous people\u2019s relationships with country are discussed from various speaking positions, including identity and knowledge, the homelands debate, water planning, climate change and market environmentalism.

Positive impacts are recorded on beneficiaries\u2019 production, incomes, food consumption, school enrolment, child health, and reduced need for earnings from undertaking casual labour for others. There is evidence of indirect economy-wide impacts, but this is not as strong as might be expected. Targeting and graduation are identified as critically important issues requiring continuing attention.","seriesTitle":null,"license":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-nd\/3.0\/","vendorItemPage":"http:\/\/ukcatalogue.oup.com\/product\/9780199683529.do#.UhxtjKwwr_k","seriesISSN":null,"grant":null,"GrantNumber":null,"id":[{"source":"oapen_id","id":455811},{"source":"doi","id":null},{"source":"isbn","id":"9780199683529"}],"itemPage":"http:\/\/www.oapen.org\/record\/45581","downloadPage":"http:\/\/oapen.org\/download?type=document&docid=455811"},{"title":"Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice for All Families","language":"ENGLISH","abstract":"The 2007 Groves Conference on Marriage and Family in Detroit offered family scholars and practitioners an opportunity to focus on the social, economic, and environmental issues facing families.

This study shows how, through musical creativity, Duna people maintain a connection with their past, and their identity, whilst simultaneously embracing the challenges of the present.","seriesTitle":null,"license":"http:\/\/press.anu.edu.au\/about\/conditions-use","vendorItemPage":"http:\/\/epress.anu.edu.au\/titles\/steep_slopes_citation","seriesISSN":null,"grant":null,"GrantNumber":null,"id":[{"source":"oapen_id","id":459734},{"source":"doi","id":null},{"source":"isbn","id":"9781921666438"}],"itemPage":"http:\/\/www.oapen.org\/record\/45973","downloadPage":"http:\/\/oapen.org\/download?type=document&docid=459734"},{"title":"Troubled Waters: Confronting the Water Crisis in Australia's Cities","language":"ENGLISH","abstract":"Australian cities have traditionally relied for their water on a \u2018predict-and-provide\u2019 philosophy that gives primacy to big engineering solutions.

The two decades from 1970 to the Bicentennial in 1988 saw the emergence of a new landscape in Australian Indigenous politics. There were struggles, triumphs and defeats around land rights, community control of organisations, national coalitions and the international movement for Indigenous rights. The changes of these years generated new roles for Aboriginal people. Leaders had to grapple with demands to be administrators and managers as well as spokespeople and lobbyists. The challenges were personal as well as organisational, with a central one being how to retain personal integrity in the highly politicised atmosphere of the \u2018Aboriginal Industry\u2019. Kevin Cook was in the middle of many of these changes \u2013 as a unionist, educator, land rights campaigner, cultural activist and advocate for liberation movements in Southern Africa, the Pacific and around the world. But \u2018Cookie\u2019 has not wanted to tell the story of his own life in these pages. Instead, with Heather Goodall, a long time friend, he has gathered together many of the activists with whom he worked to tell their stories of this important time. Readers are invited into the frank and vivid conversations Cookie had with forty-five black and white activists about what they wanted to achieve, the plans they made, and the risks they took to make change happen.\n\n\u201cYou never doubted Kevin Cook. His very presence made you confident because the guiding hand is always there. Equal attention is given to all. I am one of many who worked with Cookie and Judy through the Tranby days and in particular the 1988 Bicentennial March for Freedom, Justice and Hope. What days they were. I\u2019m glad this story is being told.\u201d\n\nLinda Burney, MLA New South Wales\n\n\u201cKevin Cook was a giant in the post-war struggle for Aboriginal rights. His ability to connect the dots and make things happen was important in both the political and cultural resurgence of the 1970s onwards.\u201d\n\nMeredith Burgmann, former MLC, New South Wales\n\n\u201cKevin has had a transformative effect on the direction of my life and the lives of so many other people. This book is an important contribution to understanding not only Kevin\u2019s life but also the broader struggles for social and economic justice, for community empowerment and of the cooperative progressive movement.

The two decades from 1970 to the Bicentennial in 1988 saw the emergence of a new landscape in Australian Indigenous politics. There were struggles, triumphs and defeats around land rights, community control of organisations, national coalitions and the international movement for Indigenous rights. The changes of these years generated new roles for Aboriginal people. Leaders had to grapple with demands to be administrators and managers as well as spokespeople and lobbyists. The challenges were personal as well as organisational, with a central one being how to retain personal integrity in the highly politicised atmosphere of the \u2018Aboriginal Industry\u2019. Kevin Cook was in the middle of many of these changes \u2013 as a unionist, educator, land rights campaigner, cultural activist and advocate for liberation movements in Southern Africa, the Pacific and around the world. But \u2018Cookie\u2019 has not wanted to tell the story of his own life in these pages. Instead, with Heather Goodall, a long time friend, he has gathered together many of the activists with whom he worked to tell their stories of this important time. Readers are invited into the frank and vivid conversations Cookie had with forty-five black and white activists about what they wanted to achieve, the plans they made, and the risks they took to make change happen.\n\n\u201cYou never doubted Kevin Cook. His very presence made you confident because the guiding hand is always there. Equal attention is given to all. I am one of many who worked with Cookie and Judy through the Tranby days and in particular the 1988 Bicentennial March for Freedom, Justice and Hope. What days they were. I\u2019m glad this story is being told.\u201d\n\nLinda Burney, MLA New South Wales\n\n\u201cKevin Cook was a giant in the post-war struggle for Aboriginal rights. His ability to connect the dots and make things happen was important in both the political and cultural resurgence of the 1970s onwards.\u201d\n\nMeredith Burgmann, former MLC, New South Wales\n\n\u201cKevin has had a transformative effect on the direction of my life and the lives of so many other people.

Maintaining that the body is fundamentally plastic and that corporeal identity is constituted by a conspiracy of sensations, he pursues the question of how the body fits into\/fails to fit into its aesthetic environment and what must be done to increase the body\u2019s power to act and exist.","seriesTitle":"New Metaphysics","license":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/4.0\/","vendorItemPage":"http:\/\/openhumanitiespress.org\/plastic-bodies.html","seriesISSN":null,"grant":null,"GrantNumber":null,"id":[{"source":"oapen_id","id":530970},{"source":"doi","id":null},{"source":"isbn","id":"9781785420016"}],"itemPage":"http:\/\/www.oapen.org\/record\/53097","downloadPage":"http:\/\/oapen.org\/download?type=document&docid=530970"},{"title":"Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?","language":"ENGLISH","abstract":"\"In this book, Jan Deckers addresses the most crucial question that people must deliberate in relation to how we should treat other animals: whether we should eat animal products.\nMany people object to the consumption of animal products from the conviction that it inflicts pain, suffering, and death upon animals.

This holds with regard to both gene-Darwinism, a purified Darwinian approach biologizing the social sciences, and process- Darwinism found in the disciplines of psychology, philosophy of science, and economics. Although Darwinism is often linked to highly confirmed biological theories, some of its interpretations seem to profit from tautological claims as well, where scientific reputation cloaks ideological usage. This book discusses central tenets of Darwinism historically as well as systematically, for example the history of different Darwinian paradigms, the units-of-selection debate, and the philosophical problem of induction as basis of metaphysical Darwinism. Crucially the book addresses the Darwinian claim that evolution is governed by an immutable and unrelentingly cruel law of natural selection. Paradoxically, Darwin\u2019s theory is a static, non-evolutionary theory of evolution. The current book sketches the historical background and provides suggestions that may help to replace this approach by the idea of an evolution of evolutionary mechanisms (see Escher\u2019s \u201cDrawing Hands\u201d on the cover). This view even suggests a tendency to overcome the blindness of the knowledge acquisition of primordial Darwinian processes and allows for some freedom from external environments. This book first develops a radically Darwinian approach, then criticises this approach from within. Even Darwinism has a tendency to transcend itself.

This holds with regard to both gene-Darwinism, a purified Darwinian approach biologizing the social sciences, and process- Darwinism found in the disciplines of psychology, philosophy of science, and economics. Although Darwinism is often linked to highly confirmed biological theories, some of its interpretations seem to profit from tautological claims as well, where scientific reputation cloaks ideological usage. This book discusses central tenets of Darwinism historically as well as systematically, for example the history of different Darwinian paradigms, the units-of-selection debate, and the philosophical problem of induction as basis of metaphysical Darwinism. Crucially the book addresses the Darwinian claim that evolution is governed by an immutable and unrelentingly cruel law of natural selection. Paradoxically, Darwin\u2019s theory is a static, non-evolutionary theory of evolution. The current book sketches the historical background and provides suggestions that may help to replace this approach by the idea of an evolution of evolutionary mechanisms (see Escher\u2019s \u201cDrawing Hands\u201d on the cover). This view even suggests a tendency to overcome the blindness of the knowledge acquisition of primordial Darwinian processes and allows for some freedom from external environments. This book first develops a radically Darwinian approach, then criticises this approach from within. Even Darwinism has a tendency to transcend itself. Although the book addresses several empirical issues, it does not challenge particular findings. Instead it builds on many insights of Darwinism and provides a proposal for interpreting known empirical evidence in a different light. It should help pave the way for further developing an understanding of nature that transcends Darwinian metaphysics.","seriesTitle":null,"license":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nd\/3.0\/de","vendorItemPage":null,"seriesISSN":null,"grant":null,"GrantNumber":null,"id":[{"source":"oapen_id","id":610358},{"source":"doi","id":null},{"source":"isbn","id":"9783863950064"}],"itemPage":"http:\/\/www.oapen.org\/record\/61035","downloadPage":"http:\/\/oapen.org\/download?type=document&docid=610358"},{"title":"The corporate blog as an emerging genre of computer-mediated communication: features, constraints, discourse situation","language":"ENGLISH","abstract":"Digital technology is increasingly impacting how we keep informed, how we communicate professionally and privately, and how we initiate and maintain relationships with others.
